Here are some projects that I've created during my studying time. Short description of each project:
 - data_mining: simple book recommender system based on Linear Neural Network
 - algorytmy_ewolucyjne: solving Inverse Kinematics problem using ES($\mu$, $\lambda$, $\rho$, k)
 - praca_inz: updating existing SFNet with embeddings and different approach to data augmentation
